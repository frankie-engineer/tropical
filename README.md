# Tropical
Tropical is a Node.js terminal game inspired by Bejeweled. The goal of the game is to to match at least three of the same item by swapping 2 items. When there's a match, the matched items turn into stars temporarily and new items fall in from above to fill the gaps.

Let's say the game initially looks like this in the upper left corner: 
```
    游꼘  游볳  游꼡
    游꼡  游본  游본
    游본  游본  游꼡
```

If we swap the `游본` with the `游꼡` below it, we'll get a match since there are three `游본` in a row.

Before Swap:               
```
    游꼘  游볳  游꼡             
    游꼡  游본  游본 <--         
    游본  游본  游꼡 <--     
```

After Swap: 
```
    游꼘  游볳  游꼡
    游꼡  游본  游꼡
--> 游본  游본  游본 <--
```

This will result in a few things happening:
1) The `游본`s will briefly turn into `救넖잺` & then disappear
2) The match will be added to the player's score
3) The `游꼡 游본 游꼡` will fall down to replace the row that used to be `游본 游본 游본`
4) Three new random items will fall down to replace the row that used to be `游꼡 游본 游꼡`
5) If in the process of steps 1-4, any new matches were created, these matches will also count towards the the player's score
